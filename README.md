# Happy Birthday Slack Bot

This project is about developing a `slackbot` for slack. <br>
The objective of this bot is to run trough the data base and check if it's anyone birthday. <br>
If that is the case, the bot will send a creative message using `openAI` and tagged them in the chat. <br>
It's a fun tool to gather even more of the community.
